# ExpandZK

**Trustless Authentication Layer for AI Agents**

ExpandZK is an open-source protocol that enables secure, trustless verification of Web2 data within Web3 ecosystems, tailored for AI agents. By integrating Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) with Transport Layer Security (TLS), ExpandZK ensures that sensitive data can be authenticated without exposure, bridging Web2 and Web3 seamlessly. It empowers AI agents and decentralized applications (dApps) with privacy-preserving data verification, supporting use cases like decentralized finance (DeFi), digital identity, and beyond.

## Key Features

- **Privacy-Preserving:** Uses ZKPs to validate data integrity without revealing sensitive information.
- **Secure Bridging:** Facilitates reliable data verification between Web2 and Web3 environments.
- **AI-Ready:** Designed to provide trustless authentication for AI agents in decentralized systems.
